Create the Project Structure:
my-mern-app/
├── client/        # Frontend code (React)
|   ├── src/
|   ├── public/
|   ├── package.json   # Frontend package.json
|
├── server/        # Backend code (Node.js)
|   ├── app.js
|   ├── package.json   # Backend package.json
|
├── common/        # Shared code, configurations, etc.
|
├── package.json   # Root package.json (may contain shared dependencies)

Initialize the Frontend (React):
    In the client directory, run the following commands
    -   npx create-react-app .

Initialize the Backend (Node.js):
    -
        npm init -y
        npm install express
    -
Configure Concurrent Development:

    Install concurrently to run both the frontend and backend simultaneously:
    npm install -D concurrently

    Update the root package.json to include a script for running both parts concurrently:
    -
        "scripts": {
        "start": "concurrently \"npm run start:client\" \"npm run start:server\"",
        "start:client": "cd client && npm start",
        "start:server": "cd server && node app.js"
        }
    -

Run the Application:

    In the root directory, run:
    -   npm start
    This will start both the frontend and backend concurrently.
